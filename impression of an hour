gracies barcelonas. o what is coming.

i sit alone or in Pennsylvania
and
the blind sleep and do miracles
two little yellow butterflies
peck-at-my-heart
choice if i grow
not money, armors, dress, eating, erudition
but as i stood,
dream'd forth a long absence
was joined by the beggar

what waits shall be good
and rather-
if i lose my breath,
paint no head without its friend before you,
holding a little charity
for i hear from above o pennant of war and peace
a little sustenance, a hut and a garden, a little innocent child by either hand,
the future will be measured
won day i shall answer to everything

then everyone will hear a weird creeping thing more or less as follows--
(other to a minde diseas'd)

I was
If possible I was floating

down among the streamlet into drops
i told. i was in hand again.
i saw their faces
i realized i had risen

and for the Muse, i say bring yet help
mild aunt Liza is as much as i sit writing here,
sick and grown old
from cache or cave beyond the flow of beauty
and round her stares agape
the smoke of war:
the other asks if we cannot escape our likes and mislikes
exiles or ambu-

now the chorus i hear:
one form of the world is the sign for a body.
And title of that art
led us traverse into the moon not absolutely

youknow that, insofarforth as, all up to do especially, we recognise that:

the endorsement of all,
pestilence, tryanny,
countless years drawing themselves onward and outward,
nothing collapses


the foot of ohoho honest
is now
what i have dared to open my mouth on.
his burnt head high up above
what perfume shall i wear for the 
theatre of infinite folly?

Logic pervades the whole goat's throat about the essence 
of this substance 
of the sign 
on the fire.
alas you are mighty cute--
enough secrets and private nonsense?

So then he walk'd
that remaining sage, to follow evil or good,

i must admit-- hung between sea and sky

A proposition determines a logical form.

I looked, and it was I heard, growing fainter and
the other world so near,

evening was there,
and here it was I did my proper dimensions

halfway from the thought itself
some of our new struggles
i made a leap over the
Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic

how easie is it but an activity
simply killing, soaring
selfless Allself,
an abstract of the sun

and cozenage of lyfe
